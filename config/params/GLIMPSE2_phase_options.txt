Basic parameters:
  --seed arg (=15052011)               Seed of the random number generator
  --threads arg (=1)                   Number of threads

Input parameters:
  -M [ --map ] arg                     Genetic map
  --input-region arg                   Imputation region with buffers
  --output-region arg                  Imputation region without buffers
  --sparse-maf arg (=0.00100000005)    (Expert setting) Rare variant threshold
  --samples-file arg                   File with sample names and ploidy 
                                       information. One sample per line with a 
                                       mandatory second column indicating 
                                       ploidy (1 or 2). Sample names that are 
                                       not present are assumed to have ploidy 2
                                       (diploids). If the parameter is omitted,
                                       all samples are assumed to be diploid. 
                                       GLIMPSE does NOT handle the use of sex 
                                       (M/F) instead of ploidy.
  --ind-name arg                       Only used together with --bam-file. Name
                                       of the sample to be processed. If not 
                                       specified the prefix of the BAM/CRAM 
                                       file (--bam-file) is used.
  --keep-monomorphic-ref-sites         (Expert setting) Keeps monomorphic 
                                       markers in the reference panel (removed 
                                       by default)

VCF/BCF genotype likelihoods input parameters:
  --impute-reference-only-variants     Only used together with --input-gl. 
                                       Allows imputation at variants only 
                                       present in the reference panel. The use 
                                       of this option is intended only to allow
                                       imputation at sporadic missing variants.
                                       If the number of missing variants is 
                                       non-sporadic, please re-run the genotype
                                       likelihood computation at all reference 
                                       variants and avoid using this option, 
                                       since data from the reads should be 
                                       used. A warning is thrown if 
                                       reference-only variants are found.
  --input-field-gl                     Only used together with --input-gl. Use 
                                       FORMAT/GL field instead of FORMAT/PL to 
                                       read genotype likelihoods
  --use-gl-indels                      (Expert setting) Only used together with
                                       --input-gl. Use genotype likelihoods at 
                                       indels from the VCF/BCF file. By default
                                       GLIMPSE assumes flat likelihoods at 
                                       non-SNP variants, as genotype 
                                       likelihoods from low-coverage data are 
                                       often miscalibrated, potentially 
                                       affecting neighbouring variants.

  --pbwt-modulo-cm arg (=0.100000001)  (Expert setting) Frequency of PBWT 
                                       selection in cM (positive number). This 
                                       parameter is automatically adjusted in 
                                       case of small imputation regions
  --Kinit arg (=1000)                  (Expert setting) Number of states used 
                                       for initialization (positive number). 
                                       Can be set to zero only when 
                                       –state-list is set, to skip the 
                                       selection for the initialization step
  --Kpbwt arg (=2000)                  (Expert setting)  Maximum number of

                                       (positive number). Can be set to zero 
                                       only when –state-list is set, to skip 
                                       the selection for during the Gibbs 
                                       iterations

                                       conditioning set, independent from state
                                       selection. Not affected by other 
                                       selection parameters. Each row is a 
                                       target haplotype (two lines per sample 
                                       in case of diploid individuals) each 
                                       column is a space separated list of 
                                       reference haplotypes (in numberical 
                                       order 0-(2N-1) ). Useful when prior 
                                       knowledge of relatedness between the 
                                       reference and target panel is known a 
                                       priori.

BAM/CRAM options and filters:
  --call-model arg (=standard)         Model to use to call the data. Only the 
                                       standard model is available at the 
                                       moment.
  --call-indels                        (Expert setting) Use the calling model 
                                       to produce genotype likelihoods at 
                                       indels. However the likelihoods from 
                                       low-coverage data can be miscalibrated, 
                                       therefore by default GLIMPSE does only 
                                       imputation into the haplotype scaffold 
                                       (assuming flat likelihoods)

  --mapq arg (=10)                     Minimum mapping quality for a read to be
                                       considered
  --baseq arg (=10)                    Minimum phred-scalde based quality to be
                                       considered
  --max-depth arg (=40)                (Expert setting) Max read depth at a 
                                       site. If the number of reads exceeds 
                                       this number, the reads at the sites are 
                                       downsampled (e.g. to avoid artifactual 
                                       coverage increases)
  --keep-orphan-reads                  (Expert setting) Keep paired end reads

  --check-proper-pairing               (Expert setting) Discard reads that are 
                                       not properly paired
  --keep-failed-qc                     (Expert setting) Keep reads that fail 
                                       sequencing QC (as indicated by the 
                                       sequencer)
  --keep-duplicates                    (Expert setting) Keep duplicate 
                                       sequencing reads in the process

                                       encoding for the base quality (for older
                                       sequencing machines)

Output parameters:
  -O [ --output ] arg                  Phased and imputed haplotypes in 
                                       VCF/BCF/BGEN format
  --contigs-fai arg                    If specified, header contig names and 
                                       their lengths are copied from the 
                                       provided fasta index file (.fai). This 
                                       allows to create imputed whole-genome 
                                       files as contigs are present and can be 
                                       easily merged by bcftools
  --bgen-bits arg (=8)                 (Expert setting) Only used toghether 
                                       when the output is in BGEN file format. 
                                       Specifies the number of bits to be used 
                                       for the encoding probabilities of the 
                                       output BGEN file. If the output is in 
                                       the .vcf[.gz]/.bcf format, this value is
                                       ignored. Accepted values: 1-32
  --bgen-compr arg (=zstd)             (Expert setting) Only used toghether 
                                       when the output is in BGEN file format. 
                                       Specifies the compression of the output 
                                       BGEN file. If the output is in the 
                                       .vcf[.gz]/.bcf format, this value is 
                                       ignored. Accepted values: [no,zlib,zstd]
