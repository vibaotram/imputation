Usage: workflow/scripts/GeneImp.R [options]


Options:
	--klthresh=KLTHRESH
		Size of the imputation window. Larger values will result in larger windows. The klthresh option determines the size of the imputation window. In target data with average sequencing depth 0.5x setting the klthresh to 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 resulted in windows with median length 58, 79, 100, 121, 142kb respectively. In data with deeper sequencing smaller values for the klthresh should be used to get windows with similar median lengths. Only the central part of each window is imputed based on the flanksize option.

	--flanksize=FLANKSIZE
			
Size of the flanking segments left and right of the imputation window. The flanksize option determines the size of the overlap between windows). Only the central part of each window is imputed. A value of 0.5 means that approximately 25% of the reads come from the left flanking segment, 50% of the reads from the window to be imputed, and 25% of the reads from the right flanking segment.

	--filtermethod=FILTERMETHOD
		Method for selecting reference haplotypes. Choose one of these: 'pairrand', 'paircond', 'marginal', 'random', or 'none'

	--numfilterhaps=NUMFILTERHAPS
		Number of reference haplotypes to select in the filtering step.

	--verbose=VERBOSE
		Print various messages as the code executes.

	--diagnostics=DIAGNOSTICS
		Set to TRUE to write imputation diagnostics, such as window positions, filtered haplotypes and haplotype probabilities. Files are written in the temp.dir if specified. CAREFUL: these files are written for every sample.
